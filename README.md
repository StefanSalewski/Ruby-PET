# Ruby-PET
Electronic schematics editor (inspired by gschem/gEDA) -- Ruby GTK3 version

This is a simple editor for electronics schematics diagrams written in Ruby
programming language. Graphical user interface uses GTK3 and Cairo.

Tested with Ruby 2.2, GTK 3.16 and Ruby-Gnome2 3.06 (git version) with Linux.
Using it with Windows or Mac OS may work also.

This is an early, still unfinished version. But most work is done,
what is left is only plain cleanup work and adding some missing features.

The goal of this project was to create an easy to use, nice looking tool
mostly compatible with the more powerful gschem editor of the gEDA project.

By using a high level language like Ruby it was possible coding this tool
in only 6000 lines of code, and it should be easy for people with basic
programming skills to extend the tool or to fix bugs.

Maybe a version of the tool in one of the new compiled, fast language like
Nim, Crystal, Rust will follow...
